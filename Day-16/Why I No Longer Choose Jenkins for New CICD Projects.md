## 🛠️ Why I No Longer Choose Jenkins for New CICD Projects

I've been in the DevOps space for over **5 years**, working across a wide range of CI/CD implementations—from monolithic apps to microservices, from bare-metal builds to containerized Kubernetes deployments.

Like many engineers, my journey with CI/CD began with **Jenkins**.  
It was powerful, flexible, and endlessly customizable through plugins.  
But as the DevOps ecosystem evolved, so did my perspective.

> Today, I strongly believe:  
> **For new projects, it’s time to stop using Jenkins.**

## 🧱 Respect Where It's Due: Jenkins Was a Game-Changer

Jenkins deserves massive respect. It empowered teams to:

- Automate builds, tests, and deployments at scale  
- Use both declarative and scripted pipelines  
- Extend functionality with plugins for almost anything  
- Run on any infrastructure  

In my early years in DevOps, Jenkins taught me a lot—especially how to break and fix pipelines 😄.

But over time, I realized maintaining Jenkins at scale came with a cost.

## ⚡ Why GitHub Actions (and Others) Are Simply Better in 2025

The DevOps ecosystem has changed.  
Modern tools like **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI** now offer:

| Feature                     | Jenkins 🧱                 | GitHub Actions ⚡         |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Setup & Maintenance        | Manual, with frequent patching | Hosted, zero-maintenance     |
| Plugin Management          | High overhead, version issues | Marketplace-based integrations |
| Security Best Practices    | Requires manual setup      | Built-in with tight GitHub integration |
| Secrets Management         | Needs plugins or external tools | Native secret support 🔐   |
| Container Support          | Requires scripting/plugins | First-class Docker/K8s support |
| Dev Experience             | UI + Jenkinsfile            | Clean YAML + native GitHub UI |

## ✅ Why GitHub Actions Works Best for Me

- Built-in support for matrix builds and environments 🧪  
- Seamless integration with pull requests and issues 🧩  
- Fast execution using GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners ⚙️  
- Great community support and reusable workflows 🔁  
- Less time managing infra, more time shipping features 🚀  

For a DevOps Engineer in 2025, the productivity and maintainability gains are too big to ignore.

## 💬 My Take

I still respect Jenkins. It played a key role in shaping modern DevOps practices.

But when I start new projects today, I reach for **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CICD**—tools built for the cloud-native era.
