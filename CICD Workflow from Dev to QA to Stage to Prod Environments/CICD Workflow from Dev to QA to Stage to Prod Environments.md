**CI/CD Workflow Across Different Environments (Dev → QA → Staging → Prod)**

A **CI/CD pipeline** automates the process of software delivery, ensuring that code changes are built, tested, and deployed efficiently across multiple environments. The typical CI/CD workflow moves through different environments:

**Development (Dev)**

**Quality Assurance (QA)**

**Staging (Pre-Production)**

**Production (Prod)**

Each environment has a specific purpose and validation steps before deploying changes to the next stage.

---

**1. CI/CD Workflow**

We follow a **Git branching strategy** where each environment has its own branch:

---

**2. CI/CD Workflow**

**Step 1: Development (Dev) Workflow**

•	**Feature Branch (feature/*) → Develop Branch (develop)**

•	Developers create a feature/* branch for each task/bug fix.

•	**CI Pipeline triggers on feature branches:**

o	Code linting and static analysis (SonarQube, ESLint)

o	Unit tests (JUnit, PyTest)

o	Build artifacts (Docker image, JAR, WAR)

•	Once **feature is completed, a Pull Request (PR) is merged into develop**.

•	**CD Pipeline triggers on develop branch**:

o	Deploys to **Dev environment** for testing.

o	Runs integration tests.

o	If stable, code is promoted to **release branch**.

---

**Step 2: Quality Assurance (QA) Workflow**

•	**Develop Branch (develop) → Release Branch (release)**

•	Once Dev testing is successful, a **merge request from develop to release** is created.

•	**CI/CD pipeline triggers on release branch:**

o	Deploys the latest build to **QA**.

o	Runs **automated test cases** (Selenium, API tests, Performance tests).

•	If QA team **approves**, the build is merged to **taging branch**.

---

**Step 3: Staging Workflow**

•	**Release Branch (release) → Staging Branch (staging)**

•	Once QA is successful, a **PR from release to staging** is created.

•	**CD pipeline triggers on staging branch**:

o	Deploys to **Staging**.

o	Runs **User Acceptance Testing (UAT).**

o	Security and Compliance Scans (Trivy, Snyk).

•	If approved, the build is tagged as **Ready for Production.**

•	A merge request from staging to main is created.

---

**Step 4: Production (Prod) Workflow**

•	**Staging Branch (staging) → Main Branch (main)**

•	Once UAT is complete:

o	Code is merged into the main branch.

o	A manual approval step is required before deployment.

•	**CD pipeline triggers on main branch**:

o	Deploys to **Production** using **Blue-Green / Canary / Rolling Deployment**.

o	Monitors application performance.

o	Enables rollback if issues occur.

**4. Example CI/CD Pipeline Triggers Based on Branch**

GitLab CI/CD Example

```bash
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  IMAGE_NAME: "myapp"

# CI Pipeline for Feature & Develop Branches
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building application..."
    - docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME .
  only:
    - develop
    - /^feature\/.*/

# Deploy to QA from release branch
deploy_to_qa:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to QA..."
  only:
    - release

# Deploy to Staging from staging branch
deploy_to_staging:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to Staging..."
  only:
    - staging

# Deploy to Production from main branch
deploy_to_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to Production..."
  only:
    - main
  when: manual  # Requires manual approval
```

**5. Deployment Strategies**

**1. Blue-Green Deployment**:

•	Two environments (blue and green), switch traffic between them for zero downtime.

**2. Canary Deployment**:

•	Gradually roll out new changes to a small percentage of users before full rollout.

**3. Rolling Updates:**

•	Deploy updates gradually in small batches to avoid downtime.

---

**6. Rollback Strategy**

•	**Rollback on Failure**: If monitoring detects issues, revert to the last stable version.

•	**Database Rollbacks**: Use schema versioning tools (Liquibase, Flyway).

•	**Previous Docker Image**: kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment-name>

---

**7. Monitoring & Logging**

•	**Prometheus + Grafana** → Metrics visualization.

•	**ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** → Log management.

•	**Alerting**→ PagerDuty, Slack notifications.

---

**8. Summary**

•	**Feature branches** (feature/*) → **Develop branch (develop)** (for Dev testing).

•	**Release branch (release)** (for QA testing).

•	**Staging branch (staging)** (for final validation).

•	**Main branch (main)** (for production deployments).

•	Each branch triggers a respective **CI/CD pipeline** to ensure smooth deployment.

This ensures **automation, stability, and rollback support** across environments.
