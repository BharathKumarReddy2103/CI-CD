**What is CI/CD?**

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) or Continuous Delivery (CD)**. It is a set of DevOps practices that aim to automate the software development lifecycle, ensuring faster, reliable, and efficient software releases.

**Continuous Integration (CI)**

CI focuses on automatically integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository multiple times a day. The main goal is to detect and fix issues early.

• Developers push code to a version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

• Automated builds and tests are triggered using CI tools like **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI.**

• If tests pass, the code is merged into the main branch.

**Continuous Deployment (CD) vs. Continuous Delivery (CD)**

  • **Continuous Delivery**: The code is automatically tested and packaged but requires manual approval before deployment.

  • **Continuous Deployment**: The code is automatically tested and deployed to production without manual intervention.

**How Does CI/CD Work?**

A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of integrating, testing, and deploying code. Here’s how it works:

1.	**Code Commit**

o	Developers push code to a shared repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

2.	**Automated Build**

o	The CI system compiles the code and resolves dependencies.

3.	**Automated Testing**

o	Unit tests, integration tests, security scans, and performance tests are executed.

4.	**Artifact Generation**

o	A deployable artifact (Docker image, JAR, etc.) is created.

5.	**Deployment (CD)**

o	The artifact is deployed to staging, QA, or production environments.

6.	**Monitoring & Feedback**

o	Logs, metrics, and alerts are monitored to ensure stability.

**Tools Used**:

•	**CI Tools**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Azure DevOps

•	**Build Tools**: Maven, Gradle, Docker

•	**Testing Tools**: JUnit, Selenium, SonarQube

•	**Deployment Tools**: Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Helm, Terraform

**Why CI/CD?**

**Business Benefits:**

✅ **Faster Releases** – Code is deployed multiple times daily instead of monthly or yearly.

✅ **Improved Code Quality** – Automated testing ensures fewer bugs.
  
✅ **Reduced Manual Effort** – Everything is automated, reducing human errors.
  
✅ **Better Collaboration** – Dev and Ops teams work together.
  
✅ **Scalability** – Helps large teams handle complex projects.

**Legacy CI/CD Setup**

Before modern CI/CD tools, companies followed traditional deployment methods:

1.	**Manual Code Integration** – Developers merged code manually.
  
2.	**Manual Testing** – QA teams manually tested applications.
  
3.	**Manual Deployment** – Ops teams deployed apps using scripts.
	
4.	**Infrastructure Management** – Servers were configured manually.

**Problems with Legacy CI/CD:**

❌ Slow releases (monthly or yearly).

❌ Higher failure rates due to manual errors.

❌ Difficult rollbacks in case of failures.

❌ Long testing cycles delaying production.

**Advanced CI/CD Setup**

Modern CI/CD pipelines use cloud-native and containerized solutions for **faster, automated, and scalable deployments**.

**Key Features**:

•	**GitOps-Based Deployments** – Uses Git as a single source of truth (e.g., ArgoCD, FluxCD).

•	**Microservices & Kubernetes** – Deploys individual services independently.

•	**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible for infrastructure automation.

•	**Automated Canary & Blue-Green Deployments** – Ensures zero-downtime releases.

•	**Security & Compliance Checks** – Integrated DevSecOps with tools like Snyk and SonarQube.

**Example Advanced CI/CD Pipeline**:

1.	**Developers push code** → GitHub/GitLab

2.	**CI/CD pipeline is triggered** → Jenkins/GitHub Actions
  
3.	**Automated build & test** → Docker, Selenium, SonarQube
  
4.	**Artifact is stored** → AWS ECR, Nexus, JFrog Artifactory

5.	**Deployment to Kubernetes** → ArgoCD, Helm

6.	**Monitoring & Alerts** → Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog

**CI/CD Setup in Top MNCs**

**How MNCs Implement CI/CD?**

1.	**Cloud-Native CI/CD**

o	AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps, Google Cloud Build

2.	**Containerized Deployments**

o	Docker, Kubernetes, Helm

3.	**Microservices Architecture**

o	CI/CD for each microservice instead of monolithic apps

4.	**Multi-Cloud Deployments**

o	Deployments on AWS, Azure, and GCP for reliability

5.	**Security-First Approach (DevSecOps)**

o	Automated vulnerability scanning, policy enforcement

6.	**AI-Powered CI/CD**

o	AI-driven testing, smart rollback mechanisms

**CI/CD Example in a Top MNC (Netflix, Amazon, Google)**

•	**Netflix**: Spinnaker + Kubernetes + Jenkins for CD

•	**Amazon**: AWS CodePipeline + Lambda + Kubernetes

•	**Google**: Cloud Build + GKE + ArgoCD

**How to Build a Robust CI/CD Pipeline**

**1. Choose Your Version Control System (VCS)**

•	GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

**2. Set Up a CI/CD Tool**

•	Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps

**3. Define Pipeline Stages**

•	**Build** – Compile and package code

•	**Test** – Automated testing (unit, integration, security)

•	**Artifact Storage** – Store artifacts in Nexus or Artifactory

•	**Deployment** – Deploy to staging/production

•	**Monitoring & Logging** – Prometheus, Grafana, ELK

**4. Automate Deployment Strategies**

•	**Rolling Deployments** – Deploy services gradually

•	**Blue-Green Deployments** – Switch between old and new versions

•	**Canary Releases** – Test new versions on a small subset of users

**5. Implement Security in CI/CD (DevSecOps)**

•	Static code analysis (SonarQube)

•	Container security (Trivy, Aqua Security)

•	Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager

**6. Monitor and Optimize**

•	Use **Prometheus + Grafana** for observability

•	Automate rollbacks with **ArgoCD, Kubernetes**

•	Scale workloads dynamically using **Kubernetes HPA**
